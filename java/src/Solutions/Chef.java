     A chef who owns his own restaurant has earned a reputation for creating
     fabulous new dishes by combining unusual ingredients. He has formulated a new
     recipe to release in conjunction with the opening of two new restaurants. The
     recipe uses ginger soda as one of the ingredients of a mushroom sauce, and the
     chef is very particular about the quality and flavor of the ginger soda. He found a
     supplier in Europe that produces a high-quality ginger soda he wants to
     purchase, but they only sell it in liters and he has specified the required quantity
